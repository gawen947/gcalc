| A basic RPN calculator from command line |
+==========================================+

Everything is passed from the command line. There isn't any interactive mode. 
This calculator use Reverse Polish Notation (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation for details).

Example:
	Consider the following infix expression : 
		5 + (3 * 4) / 6 - 2
	This could be evaluated with gcalc using those arguments :
		gcalc 5 3 4 * 6 / 2 - +
	In order to avoid the shell expander another option is :
		gcalc 5 3 4 . 6 / 2 - +

Results are printed to standard output. Intermediate results could be shown with
the "=" operator. The program return the number of elements (operators and values) 
left into the stack. If the whole expression has been evaluated it returns zero.

TODOs:
	- operator list in README
	- operator list from help inside gcalc
	- show commit in version
